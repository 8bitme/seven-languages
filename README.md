# Ruby

The sample code all works fine as is.

# Scala

All code samples work correctly now.

kids.scala & sizer.scala had deprecated code and is marked as such now.

The new kids.scala & sizer.scala uses akka actors instead of the deprecated scala methods.

On sizer.scala and sizer_deprecated.scala some of the URL's (usually amazon.com) might return HTTP 503 errors. I think this is a self defence mechanism on the website's side to prevent DDOS attacks.
